If a variable of a parent class holds the reference to an object of a descendent class, only methods defined in the parent class are allowed to be invoked using the variable of the parent class

 Unless fun() is defined in class A, the call x.fun() should result in a compilation error even if B and C contains the declaration for fun(). This is because if a variable of a parent class holds the reference to an object of a descendent class, only methods defined in the parent class are allowed to be invoked using the variable of the parent class.
